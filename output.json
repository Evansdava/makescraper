So, does that mean he‚Äôs happy that he gets to showboat *extra* hard this time, because his opponent isn‚Äôt a total pushover, or does it mean he‚Äôs going to acknowledge White Chain has some potential.Then again, even if he did acknowlege her, would that result in him actually changing his course, or just killing her harder?Either way, I think the next few panels will tell us the course of everything to follow."

Maybe use a filter to seperate some of the organic material from the metals Afterwards use sulfides to precipitate the metals from the ash. Maybe use electrolytic refining to get a solid metal mixture and then use difference in melting points to slag away the different metals until I got pure iron.\nGranted, this is a very obtuse, innefficient and expensive method and you‚Äôd be better of just mining for the stuff. But hey! You‚Äôd get some serious cool points if you made a sword out of like 500 dudes. Since you have about 4 to 3,5 grams of iron in your body."
